Menu-based Java application that allows you to add employee details, display all employees, and exit. The employee details will be stored in a file, and the program will
read the file to display the stored employee information.

Steps:
1. Create an Employee class with fields like name, id, designation, and salary.
2. Create a menu with three options:
Add an Employee
Display All Employees
Exit
3. Store Employee Data in a File: Serialize the employee objects and store them in a file.
4. Read Employee Data from the File: Deserialize the employee objects from the file and display the details.
5. Handle Exceptions: Handle file I/O exceptions.



---Implementation
  
Employee Class: This class contains details like name, id, designation, and salary. It implements Serializable to allow serialization of Employee objects.
addEmployee(): This method takes input from the user for an employee's details, creates an Employee object, and saves it to a file using ObjectOutputStream.
saveEmployeeToFile(): This method appends employee details to a file. The file is opened in append mode (true parameter in FileOutputStream).
displayAllEmployees(): This method reads all employee objects from the file and prints their details.
readEmployeesFromFile(): This method reads the employee objects from the file using ObjectInputStream and stores them in a list. 
The loop continues until the end of the file is reached (IOFException).




Test Cases:

Test Case 1: Add a new employee and display all employees.
Steps: Select option 1 to add a new employee, then select option 2 to display all employees.
Input:
Employee Name: John Doe
Employee ID: 101
Designation: Software Engineer
Salary: 50000
  
Expected Output:
Employee added successfully!
Employee ID: 101, Name: John Doe, Designation: Software Engineer, Salary: 50000.0

Test Case 2: Try adding multiple employees and display all of them.
Steps: Add multiple employees (using option 1) and then display all employees (using option 2).
Expected Output:
Employee added successfully!
Employee ID: 101, Name: John Doe, Designation: Software Engineer, Salary: 50000.0
Employee added successfully!
Employee ID: 102, Name: Jane Smith, Designation: Manager, Salary: 75000.0
